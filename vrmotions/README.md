## Data Structure

Each folder contains a single file representing one day of data collection (e.g., Quest Day 1, Quest Day 2, Vive Day 1, etc.) using different systems. These files are stored as NumPy arrays with the shape (41, 10, 135, 21). The first dimension indexes the subject ID, while the second corresponds to the sequential throws performed by the user. The third dimension represents the temporal sequence, and the fourth captures the feature set at each time step. Each feature vector includes the position (x, y, z), Euler angles (x, y, z), and trigger pressure (ranging from 0 to 1) for the right-hand controller, headset, and left-hand controller. Trigger pressure values for the headset are always set to zero.
