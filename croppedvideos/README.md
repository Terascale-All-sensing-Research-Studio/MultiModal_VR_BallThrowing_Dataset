## Cropped GoPro Videos
For each participant we recorded external video using a GoPro Hero 7 color camera. The camera was set at a resolution of 1280x960 with a frame rate of 60 frames per second. Each GoPro color video was manually aligned to the recorded VR motions. To ensure consistency, all video alignments were performed by a single researcher on the team. Once the videos are aligned to the VR motion, they are cropped to have the same spatial resolution such that no participant goes out of the frame during the entire interaction. All final processed videos have a resolution of 480x528 at 60 frames per second. As a note, in general participants stood closer to the camera when using the HTC Cosmos, so the frame is filled more for those sessions. The final processed videos are stored in MPEG-4 (or MP4) format.

## Directory Structure
We provide individual directories for each VR system, namely Meta Quest, HTC Vive, and HTC Vive Cosmos, and day. The folder structure is as follows:

+ [cosmos_day1](cosmos_day1): contains individual subfolders for each participant's day 1 throw using the HTC Vive Cosmos. The subfolder is named as XXX_Cosmos_1, where XXX is a 3-digit participant ID. Each subfolder contains 10 MP4 files named 0.mp4 to 9.mp4 for each of the 10 trials for the day. 
+ [cosmos_day2](cosmos_day2): contains individual subfolders for each participant's day 2 throw using the HTC Vive Cosmos. The subfolder is named as XXX_Cosmos_2, where XXX is a 3-digit participant ID. Each subfolder contains 10 MP4 files named 0.mp4 to 9.mp4 for each of the 10 trials for the day. 
+ [quest_day1](quest_day1): contains individual subfolders for each participant's day 1 throw using the Meta Quest. The subfolder is named as XXX_Quest_1, where XXX is a 3-digit participant ID. Each subfolder contains 10 MP4 files named 0.mp4 to 9.mp4 for each of the 10 trials for the day. 
+ [quest_day2](quest_day2): contains individual subfolders for each participant's day 2 throw using the Meta Quest. The subfolder is named as XXX_Quest_2, where XXX is a 3-digit participant ID. Each subfolder contains 10 MP4 files named 0.mp4 to 9.mp4 for each of the 10 trials for the day. 
+ [vive_day1](vive_day1): contains individual subfolders for each participant's day 1 throw using the HTC Vive. The subfolder is named as XXX_Vive_1, where XXX is a 3-digit participant ID. Each subfolder contains 10 MP4 files named 0.mp4 to 9.mp4 for each of the 10 trials for the day. 
+ [vive_day2](vive_day2): contains individual subfolders for each participant's day 2 throw using the HTC Vive. The subfolder is named as XXX_Vive_2, where XXX is a 3-digit participant ID. Each subfolder contains 10 MP4 files named 0.mp4 to 9.mp4 for each of the 10 trials for the day.
